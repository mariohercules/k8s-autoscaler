Kubow is an architecture-based self-adaptation service for Kubernetes applications. 

Kubow was implemented as a Docker and Kubernetes customization of the [Rainbow](https://github.com/cmu-able/rainbow) self-adaptive framework, originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University's [ABLE research group](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/). 

As with Rainbow, Kubow's primary features are:

* separates out the concern of self-adaptation from the managed system;
* uses software archiecture models as the basis for reasoning about the state of the system and applicable adaptations;
* uses utility-based decision making to determine the best adaptation among a set of potentially applicable adaptations;

To watch a simple example of Kubow in action, check out this [video](https://youtu.be/_-aLNksiKXI).

## Getting started

To get started with Kubow, you first need to install some auxiliary tools (e.g., metrics-server, custom-metrics-api, prometheus, kube-state-metrics) in your Kubernetes cluster. Those tools' deployment files can be found in the [tools](./tools) folder.

After that, you can go to the [samples](./samples) folder and choose one the available sample applications to be deployed and managed by Kubow. Each application has its own subfolder containing its required deployment files.
