After lots of user criticism and disbelief, Microsoft has moved swiftly to do something about it - by tweaking the typography.\n\nIt has long been known that text in all CAPITAL LETTERS is more difficult to read. It may carry emphasis, but because it lacks the familiar ups and downs in letter height when mixed case characters are used, it just isn\'t as easy to read. It also is just plain tiring to be shouted at in caps all the time - just see the response to any forum newbie who has failed to take the caps lock off.\n\nBut despite all this Microsoft is going to continue to shout at developers by using an all-caps main menu in Visual Studio  2012. The blog post explaining the reason is worth reading, if only to get a clear picture of how style is winning out over substance\n\n\"We’ve chosen to use uppercase styling in the top menu for two main reasons: 1) to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user experiences, and 2) to provide added structure to the top menu bar area.\"\n\nYou might argue that 2 is a UI plus point but 1 is basically a \"we do it elsewhere so we will keep doing it for the sake of how things look\".\n\n\"On the first point, the use of uppercase text is becoming a strong signature element of styling for navigation and headings in Microsoft user interfaces. You can see it in the Azure Portal, in Zune, and in the latest Bing search results update.\"\n\nSo let\'s forget usability and keep with the \"strong signature element\". It doesn\'t matter that it is harder to read, the brand will be more recognizable in caps.\n\n\"On the second point, we explored designs with and without uppercase styling. In the end we determined it to be a very effective way of providing structure and emphasis to the top menu area in Visual Studio 2012.\"\n\nThis must be a new meaning of the word \"structure\", because putting the menu items into all-caps means that they are all the same height. When each menu items starts with a cap then there is structure because you can see the change in height, marking the start of the next menu item. The idea that putting a menu into all caps adds structure is something that is very difficult to see.\n\nYou can compare the two approaches and see if you agree. First the mixed case menu:\n\nand the all caps menu:\n\nDon\'t forget to click on each of the images to see them full size - it is worth the effort. You would have to be an idiot or brainwashed to think that all caps has more structure than mixed case menus.\n\nBeing very gracious, the blog does point out that you can customize your VS environment but doesn\'t point out that at the moment this isn\'t easy or obvious.\n\nIn mitigation it is pointed out that the design has been tweaked as a result of user feedback:\n\n\"...we tuned the typography of the menu to better adjust to uppercase text, including increased spacing between menu items from 14px to 20px to make menu items stand out better.\"\n\nThis is almost laughable. If you had to write a Microsoft comedy sketch you could include it without much effort to add parody.\n\nProgrammers and UI experts to design guy:\n\n\"Mixed case is more readable and this is a long established fact\"\n\nDesign guy:\n\n\"We tweaked the spacing from 14px to 20px\"\n\nIf you wanted to put structure into a menu, well how about color?\n\nOh wait I forgot the design department dumped color in favour of the \"everything-is-grey UI\".\n\nDevelopers are the people who invented CamelCase to make sure that the structure of run together words would stand out better - and now we are asked to believe that making a menu all-caps adds structure.\n\nI don\'t think so.\n\nThe worrying part is that this attitude of design over usability seems to be a common feature of VS 2012 and Windows 8. Let\'s hope there is still time to change.\n',2),(2,'Could Cops Use Google To Prevent Murder?','At around 3:45 a.m. on March 24, someone in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., used a mobile phone to Google “chemicals to passout a person.” Then the person searched Ask.com for “making people faint.” Then Google again, for “ways to kill people in their sleep,” “how to suffocate someone,” and “how to poison someone.”\n\nThe phone belonged to 23-year-old Nicole Okrzesik. Later that morning, police allege, she and her boyfriend strangled 19-year-old Juliana Mensch as she slept on the floor of their apartment. The Google searches, along with incriminating text messages between Okrzesik and her boyfriend, came to light as authorities investigated Mensch’s death. But what if they could have been alerted to the suspicious-sounding searches immediately? Could they have rushed to the apartment and saved the girl’s life?\n\nIn Minority Report, police use mutant psychics to predict murders before they happen and lock up the would-be killers. The mutant psychics are fantasy, but when we keep hearing about cases in which people Google their crimes before they commit them, the concept of a police “pre-crime” unit is no longer so far-fetched. The most interesting thing about the idea of using Web searches to predict murders: It might be perfectly legal.\n\nPolice already draw on other types of data to anticipate crimes. Police departments in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, Calif., have been experimenting with “predictive policing,” in which computer algorithms sift through reams of crime data to tell officers where and when crimes are likely to occur. That’s a long way, though, from the type of pre-cognition portrayed in Minority Report. It only works for relatively predictable crimes such as burglary or auto theft, and it doesn’t tell you anything about who might be planning the heists.\n\nWeb search data, by contrast, contains information about specific individuals’ thoughts and plans. In theory, Google or Ask.com could have flagged Okrzesik’s search queries as suspicious and sent the cops her device’s IP address. In the Hollywood script, a vigilant officer would notice the alert, rush to the scene, and knock on the door just as Mensch’s assailants were about to do her in.\n\nIn reality, there are a few obstacles that scenario. For starters, police would need instant access to the search data and a way to connect it to a physical address. These days they usually get electronic records only after a crime has been committed and they’ve built up enough evidence to obtain a warrant. They use the data not to prevent crime but to build their case for arrest and conviction. In last year’s high-profile Casey Anthony trial, for instance, prosecutors told the jury they’d searched Anthony’s computer and found 84 queries related to “chloroform” in her browser history, corroborating their theory that Anthony had used the chemical to subdue her 2-year-old daughter Caylee before killing her. (Anthony was acquitted of the killing, and it later turned out that the term had been searched just once—and Casey Anthony’s mother took the stand to say she was the one who searched for it. She said she was trying to look up “chlorophyll” to see whether plant matter was dangerous for her dog to eat.)\n\nLaw enforcement agents do sometimes monitor communications in real time, as when they listen in on a suspect’s phone conversations. But federal privacy laws require a special wiretap warrant for eavesdropping, obtainable only after police have probable cause to believe an individual is guilty of a crime. (A 2008 law that allows warrantless wiretapping under certain circumstances has been appealed to the Supreme Court.) So even if it were technically feasible, police wouldn’t be allowed to monitor everyone’s phone conversations for suspicious words or phrases. The same ostensibly holds for monitoring people’s email, text messages, and Web browsing.\n\nAs for Web searches, police probably can’t require a company like Google to share its data with them without good reason, legal experts say. But unlike phone conversations, emails, and text messages, search queries aren’t protected from voluntary disclosure to authorities, notes Orin Kerr, a computer crime expert at George Washington University. When you pick up the phone to call a friend, the reasoning goes, you’re communicating with that friend, and the phone company is a third party that doesn’t have a right to eavesdrop. But when you type a query into Google’s search bar, you’re communicating directly with Google. That makes Google the “end user” of your information, and gives it the legal prerogative—at least in theory—to share that information with anyone it likes, including the police or the FBI. Kerr calls it a hole in the country’s privacy laws and has called for it to be patched.\n\nIn practice, it’s unlikely Google would do such a thing unless it felt compelled to. Asked about the company’s policies on sharing information with law enforcement, spokesman Chris Gaither told me only that Google complies with valid legal processes, takes users’ privacy seriously, and tries to notify users when it gets requests for their data. And when it does get such requests, it tries to make sure they’re tailored as narrowly as possible. The fact is that, in the absence of a law requiring it to share search information with the government, Google has more incentive to protect its customers’ privacy than to serve as an ongoing informant for the cops.\n\nBut if the idea of Internet companies sharing users’ seemingly private information with law enforcement sounds far-fetched, consider that the House of Representatives recently passed a bill to explicitly legalize and promote just that behavior. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA, would encourage the free flow of information on “cyber threats” between the government and major Web firms. Under the law, those firms would be immune from lawsuits arising from the sharing of such information. Several major tech companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, endorsed the bill. After an outcry from privacy groups, though, the Obama administration threatened a veto, and the bill has not been introduced in the Senate.\n\nThere are, though, other types of search data that companies already share with federal officials in real time. For instance, Google uses its analytics to report flu trends to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It anonymizes the data to make sure it can’t be traced to individual users, but the precedent is still one of instantaneous sharing with the government. In the U.K., meanwhile, legislation is afoot that would require Web companies to monitor users’ searches for terms indicating that they might commit suicide. Such searches would presumably produce an alert to law enforcement, who could then try to intervene to save the user’s life.\n\nEven if Google—or Ask.com or Microsoft’s Bing—did come to an understanding with American law enforcement, there would still be the practical problem of sifting the useful data from the noise. As Casey Anthony’s mother would tell you, there are plenty of reasons to search for chloroform (or chlorophyll) other than to plan a murder. Likewise, any police department that tried to track down all the searches for “how to dispose of a body without getting caught” would quickly find itself overwhelmed. And in Okrzesik’s case, the poor grammar in “chemicals to passout a person” might have kept it off the radar of even the most sophisticated monitoring algorithm.\n\nYet the next three Google searches on Okrzesik’s phone—“ways to kill people in their sleep,” “how to suffocate someone,” and “how to poison someone”—seem to clearly indicate that someone has a strong curiosity about how to kill someone. One can also imagine other searches—say, a series of queries about the ingredients used to make anthrax—that law enforcement agents might like to know about.\n\nUnlike in Minority Report, such search data probably wouldn’t be enough to justify a search warrant on its own, let alone an arrest and conviction. But David Sklansky, a criminal law professor at UC-Berkeley, says it could constitute the reasonable suspicion needed to pull someone over or stop him on the street. And police don’t need any reasonable suspicion at all to knock on someone’s door and ask what she’s up to, provided the person agrees to talk.\n\nMost of the time, even these seemingly incriminating searches would probably amount to nothing, like a burglar alarm going off in a house (a false alarm more than 95 percent of the time). It’s also possible that if it becomes public knowledge that cops and search engines are collaborating, an Internet mob could start mass-searching “ways to kill people in their sleep,” overwhelming law enforcement with phony queries. But in rare cases, it’s conceivable that search sleuthing could lead to saved lives—perhaps a great number of saved lives, in the case of a terrorist attack. That prospect, however slim, may be enough to convince search engines to at least explore the potential for increased collaboration with authorities. Murderers and the morbidly curious, be warned.\n\n',2),(3,'Claim: Encrypted Chat Developer Detained, Interrogated at US Border','A developer for encrypted chat application “Cryptocat” has recently claimed that he was detained and interrogated at the US border. Apparently, border guards took his passport and interrogated him about the application, demanding to know “which algorithms Cryptocat used and about its censorship resistance.”\n\nA developer of an encrypted chat program is making some dramatic claims. Nadim Kobeissi, developer of Cryptocat which “lets you instantly set up secure conversations. It’s an open source encrypted, private alternative to other services such as Facebook chat.”\n\nApparently, a trip to the US now allegedly features a frightening round of intense interrogation by American border guards. Kobeissi took to his Twitter account to talk about his experience, saying, “I was detained, searched, questioned on my research, with my passport confiscated for almost an hour.”\n\nHe added, “There are many perspectives I strive to understand. Justifying targeted gov. harassment, rights deprivation & interrogation is not one.”\n\nOther tweets this, “In my mind there is no question concerning interrogating someone for open source crypto work.”\n\nDetails about the experience were also posted including this, “Even though I didn’t get an SSSS this time, I was still detained, questioned and searched while transiting to Canada via the US.”\n\nThis: “Also worth noting: my passport was confiscated for around an hour.”\n\nThis: “Out of my 4 DHS interrogations in the past 3 weeks, it’s the first time I’m asked about Cryptocat crypto and my passport is confiscated.”\n\nAnd, most notably, this: “The interrogator (who claimed 22 years of computer experience) asked me which algorithms Cryptocat used and about its censorship resistance.”\n\nIf all of this is true, this is certainly a frightening turn of events. If what you develop online or what you say online as it relates to Internet freedom could impact how you are treated at the Canada, US border, it certainly would make me think twice about coming in to the US.\n',1),(4,'Ellison: Oracle will deliver world\'s \'most comprehensive cloud\'','IDG News Service - Oracle CEO Larry Ellison declared the company is ready to offer \"the most comprehensive cloud on the planet Earth,\" during a webcast event on Wednesday.\n\n\"It\'s been a long time coming,\" Ellison said of the Oracle Public Cloud, which encompasses Oracle\'s suite of Fusion Applications delivered as both SaaS (software as a service) and PaaS (platform as a service) features, including the Java Cloud Service and Database Cloud Service. It\'s also the home of Oracle Social Network, the company\'s foray into Facebook-like collaboration tools for enterprises.\n\nMost of the details discussed Wednesday were well-telegraphed, given that Oracle Public Cloud was first announced at the OpenWorld conference in October and the company had put up a website filled with specifics, save for details such as pricing and general-availability dates.\n\nThe applications will feature per-user, per-month pricing, Ellison said. But it still wasn\'t clear by the end of the presentation whether all the components are broadly available now.\n\nMeanwhile, Ellison\'s proclamation of Oracle\'s newfound cloud prowess on Wednesday stood in stark contrast to his past mockery of cloud computing as hype-filled \"gibberish\" applied improperly to long-standing technologies. Such jibes were nowhere to be found Wednesday as the CEO spun a broad strategic vision.\n\n\"We made a decision to rebuild all of our applications for the cloud almost seven years ago,\" Ellison said of Fusion Applications, which are also available on-premises. \"It took seven years of work, thousands of people, billions of dollars, to make the transition from being an on-premise application provider to being a cloud application provider, as well as an on-premise provider.\"\n\nOracle is hoping these attributes will have special allure for customers, since they\'ll be able to choose either deployment model and move applications between them.\n\nOracle is set to offer 100 different cloud applications, spanning ERP (enterprise resource planning), CRM (customer relationship management), HCM (human capital management) and other software categories, Ellison said.\n\nWednesday\'s event also provided Ellison with an opportunity to tout what he called Oracle Public Cloud\'s many advantages over rivals such as SAP and Salesforce.com, as well as to engage in some of his traditional competitive trash talk.\n',0),(5,'Insect-Inspired Device Skates Between Oil And Water','Ideas from nature have often provoked materials scientists, who have made self-cleaning surfaces inspired by lotus leaves, for example, and adhesive feet for robots that can climb walls as geckos do. Now researchers have imitated water-striding insects, constructing a device that can skate at the interface between oil and water (ACS Nano, DOI: 10.1021/nn301550v). To do so they created a surface on the device’s legs that repels oil underwater.\n\nResearchers had previously discovered that water striders’ legs work through the chemistry and physics of microprojections lined with nanogrooves on the bugs’ legs (Nature, DOI: 10.1038/432036a). Shutao Wang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, thought that he could use similar structures to solve a materials problem: Most materials that repel oil, known as oleophobic materials, don’t work if they get wet. Superoleophobic coatings that work when wet could keep bugs from sticking to car windshields, scientists think, and enable robots to move through and clean up oil spills.\n\nWang’s group created a 5-cm-long oil-striding device that stays afloat thanks to a superoleophobic coating on its four metal legs. The researchers made the device from copper wires bent into lengths resembling the insects’ legs. They used a simple method to produce a rough nanoscale coating on the wires that approximates the texture of the insects’ legs: When they immersed the wires in aqueous ammonia, it reacted with the copper to produce flowerlike microclusters of copper oxide nanopetals.\n\nTo test the surface’s ability to repel oil, Wang’s team placed the wires underwater and added droplets of 1,2-dichloroethane, an oil that is denser than water, to their surfaces. Researchers measure the interaction between a drop of liquid and a surface by measuring the angle of contact between the two. When a droplet spreads out on a surface perfectly, the contact angle is zero. If oil were to bead up into a perfect sphere on a surface, the contact angle would be 180°; any material with a contact angle above 150° is considered superoleophobic. The researchers found that contact angle between a wire and an underwater droplet of oil is about 164°.\n\nTo make an oil strider, they tied copper wires to a copper plate that mimicked the insect’s body. They bent each of the four legs, dipped the legs in ammonia, and then tested the strider’s seaworthiness. When the researchers placed the oil strider in a container with oily water and agitated the container, the strider skated on the surface between oil and water, just as a water-striding insect moves on the surface between water and air. Wang says that the coating method could work with other metals, with which researchers could use a similar oxidizing treatment, and with polymers, which would be coated with a metal oxide. Larger devices could also work, he says, as long as they are lightweight.\n\nEric Loth, of the University of Virginia, who works on oleophobic coatings for ships and planes, says a coating that works underwater like Wang’s could help ships save fuel by preventing barnacles and other sea creatures from growing on the hulls.\n\n',2),(6,'The life of a \'booth babe\': high heels, long hours and leering visitors','For six to seven hours on Wednesday, 22-year-old Amanda Lin will pose in a short black cocktail dress with a laptop from Gigabyte Technology, the company\'s logo stamped across her upper arm. Her main challenge: trying to stand comfortably in her high heels.\n\n\"They can hurt,\" Lin said of her shoes. \"But the work is pretty relaxed and you don\'t have to do a lot in order to get paid.\"\n\nLin is one of hundreds of models, often referred to as \"booth babes,\" working at the Computex trade show in Taipei this week. Wearing skimpy outfits and holding some of the hottest new tech products, they have become an attraction in their own right, enticing a predominantly male crowd of buyers to stop by vendors\' booths at the five-day show.\n\nSome models say the money is reasonable but there are drawbacks too, such as having to smile for up to eight hours a day and endure what many consider sexism.\n\nOn Tuesday, Asustek Computer came under fire from media outlets after it posted a picture on Twitter of one of its models, commenting that the woman\'s \"rear\" and the tablet she was holding both looked \"pretty nice.\"\n\nAsus quickly deleted the picture and apologized. Asked about its remark, Lin had mixed views. \"It\'s not a great feeling to see that, but there\'s nothing that can really be done. We work to promote products,\" she said.\n\nLin has worked part-time as a promotional model for the past year and said the money is easier to make than in some other jobs. Models can generally make US$100 to $130 or more for working two hours to unveil a product at a news conference in Taiwan.\n\nLin also works as a model at other electronics or car shows in Taipei. She is currently a senior in college and considering a career as a flight attendant. She said problems with sexism have been absent from her own work as a model. \"I\'m used to it,\" she said, when asked how she felt about Computex visitors ogling her and taking her picture.\n\nEileen Lee, 25, however, had a more negative view of modeling at Taiwan\'s tech shows. On Wednesday, Lee was holding a smartphone outside mobile chip maker Nvidia\'s booth, a fake tattoo of the company\'s name stamped below her left shoulder blade.\n\nOn average, Computex models make $100 to $170 for about 8 hours of work, she said, while models at other shows can make as little as $60. Lee decided to model at Computex for the money, after working in the modeling industry part-time for four years, in music videos and commercials. This year\'s show will be her last, because she\'s taking a job as a product manager at a biotech company that produces cosmetics and health products.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy, because you stand for a long time,\" she said. During her eight hour day, Lee stands for 30 minutes holding a product, then takes a 10-minute rest and repeats the process. \"You have to look happy all day and smile, but it\'s not that easy,\" she said. \"It gets very tiring.\"\n\nLee is looking forward to leaving the modeling work, especially after the Asus tweet. \"I\'m very sensitive to these kind of things, and I really want to leave this career,\" she said. \"The industry is now moving towards making models show more skin,\" she said. \"People will look at you, but do so in a way that\'s more sexist and sexual. There\'s no respect.\"\n\nAshley Hsu, 25, another Computex model, was helping to promote prizes from Taiwanese vendor Elitegroup Computer Systems. She sees it as a good part-time job, and does it when she has time away from her studies to become a hair and makeup stylist, or from her other part-time job as a dancer.\n\n\"It seems like more and more young women want to do this kind of work,\" she said. \"It\'s easy to do, you can make money. You just need to talk to people and get your picture taken. I\'m seeing a lot of people wanting to do this part-time.\"\n\nSome models at Computex work full-time in the modeling industry, such as Regina Xue, 23, who was promoting PC vendor Micro-Star International by handing out plastic fans to visitors. \"People think we are doing nothing and just daydreaming, but it\'s very difficult,\" she said. \"You have to meet a lot of people.\"\n\nShe hoped that visitors would respect her profession. \"This is a job for us, we just wear less,\" said Xue, who was in a blue mini-skirt and top. \"We are doing real work.\"\n',1),(7,'Dept. of Homeland Security to focus on cyber workforce development','Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano today said the agency will form a cybersecurity workforce task group that will consider strategies such as expanding DHS involvement in cyber competitions and university programs, enhancing public-private security partnerships and working with other government agencies to develop a more agile cyber workforce across the federal government.\n\nThe new task force will be co-chaired by hacking expert Jeff Moss who now works for the Homeland Security Advisory Council and Alan Paller is director of research at the SANS Institute.\n\nThe idea behind the task force is in part to develop strong cybersecurity career paths within DHS and other agencies. \"To accomplish this critical task, we have created a number of very competitive scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs to attract top talent,\" Napolitano stated.\n\nIn addition to protecting civilian government networks, DHS also works with owners and operators of critical infrastructure to help them secure their own networks by conducting risk assessments and developing plans to mitigate risks. Last year, the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team, part of DHS\' 24-hour watch and warning center, responded to more than 106,000 incident reports, and released more than 5,000 cybersecurity alerts and information products to public and private sector partners, Napolitano said.  DHS needs a world-class cybersecurity team - a strong, dependable cybersecurity pipeline for the future.\n\nNapolitano recently noted that DHS is looking to build what she called a \"world-class cybersecurity team - a strong, dependable pipeline for the future.\"\n\nThat includes computer engineers, scientists, analysts, and IT specialists. In fact, since Fiscal Year 2008, our National Cyber Security Division has grown by more than 600 percent. And President Obama has asked Congress for a 74 percent increase in the DHS cyber budget in Fiscal Year 2013, recognizing the national needs in this arena, Napolitano said.\n',0),(8,'Clean IT project considers terrorist content database','European governments outline partnership with internet industry.\n\nInternet users could contribute to an official blacklist of suspected terrorist content under the European Commission\'s budding \'Clean IT\' project.\n\nThe project aims to create a text that commits the internet industry (web hosts, search engines and ISPs, among others) to helping governments weed out content that incites acts of terror.\n\nPartners met in Berlin this week for the fourth Clean IT conference, led by the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice and its peers in Belgium, Germany, Spain and the UK.\n\nBut Klaasen, Program Manager at the Netherland’s National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, told iTnews that the organisations had so far developed 13 “best practice” proposals for governments and the internet industry.\n\nA final version of the text is expected to be delivered in early 2013.\n\nFlagging\n\nAmong those 13 courses of action is a proposal for a system that will allow users to ‘flag’ content they believe to be illegal when surfing the web. These alarms would be sent for review to the service provider and in turn, a government agency.\n\nParticipants in the talks were yet to narrow down how such a flagging system might work from a technical perspective, but Klaasen expected it to be among the proposals in the final Clean IT text.\n\nIdeally, the solution would be built into popular web browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, Google Chrome etc) such that users could flag suspicious material regardless of where it is hosted.\n\nAn easier but less comprehensive system would be to compel the world’s most popular content hosts – such as Google/YouTube or Amazon – to interface existing flagging systems with those of law enforcement agencies.\n\n“Flagging happens already on some sites,” Klaasen told iTnews. “Many users already flag content they find concerning on services like YouTube. But many of those flags don’t reach law enforcement.”\n\nReferral, notice and takedown\n\nA related ‘best practice’ proposal calls for governments to establish ‘referral units’ – teams of experts that analyse flagged content to assess its legal status.\n\nInternet content or access providers in Europe are already compelled to take down content if they feel its illegality is crystal clear. But often the line between dissenting content and terrorist content is blurry.\n \n\n“We can\'t expect an ISP has the right level of knowledge of terrorist content to know if something is illegal or not,” Klaasen said.\n\n“So we have to find a clever way to share the expertise within the Government with the ISPs.”\n\nAny content deemed illegal is dealt with by a third proposal, for a notice and takedown scheme.\n\nThe Clean IT standard is being coordinated with a notice and takedown scheme being managed by the European Commissioner’s Director General of Markets.\n\nTerrorist content database\n\nOne of the more recent “best practice” proposals put on the agenda has not yet been published within the draft text.\n\nIt has been proposed that an as-yet undecided authority create a database of content that has been deemed illegal and removed from a server under the flagging, notice and takedown mechanisms.\n\n“Usually when illegal material is found on a server hosted by an Internet company and is removed, it pops up two days later somewhere else,” Klaasen said.\n\n“So why not try and create a database where internet companies can check it to see if it\'s known illegal material? There are many known YouTube videos, for example, with content like be-headings. You don’t need to watch them to know if they are illegal or not.”\n\nAgain the focus of the discussions has not been on the technical requirements of such a database, but on more fundamental legal principles.\n\n“The database is just an idea at this stage,” Klaasen said.\n\n“Again it raises questions. If you have such a database, who is responsible for it? Is there a trusted organisation to maintain it? There are really important questions that we’ll look to address.”\n\nSeveral more proposals are expected to be added to the draft text of Clean IT before a conference in London in September and the delivery of the final text next year.\n',1),(9,'Dinosaurs Skinnier Than Previously Thought','Dinosaurs were often hefty, but not as plump as previously thought.\n\nA new study describes a new technique used to measure the weight and size of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. It could forever change museum exhibits, book illustrations, and other recreations of these now-extinct species. The study appears in the latest issue of Biology Letters\n\n“This is a huge help for any sort of reconstruction,” lead author William Sellers told Discovery News. “We now have a number that suggests how much flesh to add to the bones and that should help people produce animals that are the right balance of too fat or too thin.”\n\n“This technique can also allow you to calculate the numbers you need for more sophisticated locomotor reconstructions, such as the running simulations we have produced in the past,” added Sellers, who is based at the University of Manchester’s Faculty of Life Sciences.\n\nHe and his team used lasers to measure the minimum amount of skin required to wrap around the skeletons of large modern animals that included reindeer, polar bears, giraffes and elephants. Doing this, the researchers noticed that the animals had almost exactly 21 percent more body mass than the minimum skeletal “skin and bone” wrap volume.\n\nThe formula was then applied to a giant Brachiosaur skeleton housed at Berlin’s Museum für Naturkunde. Previous estimates of this dinosaur’s weight have been as high as 176,370 pounds. This latest study, however, reduces the figure to just 50,706 pounds -- impressively weighty, but not nearly as heavy.\n\n“The 23 tonne weight (50,706 pounds) is quite low, but I think it reflects the fact that all dinosaur weights are getting lower,” Sellers said, explaining that the estimated weight for this dino, along with other species, has been dropping since about the early 1960’s.\n\nHe continued that the new estimate \"reflects a better understanding of biology, and I think the early estimates were set in that big, fat and slow lizard mindset before the dinosaur renaissance. I think we will find that the lower estimates are much more appropriate for many dinosaurs.”\n\nHigh-tech scanners, fast computers and other tools were simply not available back in the day when dinosaur weights were first estimated. Up until fairly recently, even experts resorted to some fairly homespun methods for attempting to calculate dinosaur heft.\n\n“One very common method is to take an artist’s reconstruction sculpture of the animal and measure its volume by dipping it in water just like Archimedes,\" Sellers said. \"That gives you the volumes, which you can multiply by the density to get its weight.”\n\n“The problem with this is the artist’s reconstruction,” he said. “These are very time consuming to do and probably rather inaccurate, so we thought we’d try a new method.”\n\nAside from improved accuracy, the new method is minimally invasive and relatively quick. The primary limitation, for now, is that the specimen should consist of a complete skeleton that has been mounted.\n\n“This is reasonably accurate because the bones fit together like a jigsaw puzzle,” he said.\n\nHeinrich Mallison of the Museum für Naturkunde told Discovery News that the new study describes “a brilliant approach: not trying to estimate soft tissues, but finding out how much a bone-only model underestimates the entire animal\'s mass.”\n\nMallison thinks it is “certainly a very good method for mammals, but I\'d like to see tests with more details to find out if archosaurs (crocodiles and dinosaurs) have the same regressions, or differ.”\n',1),(10,'How Would You Like A Graduate Degree For $100?','This story appears in the June 25, 2012 issue of Forbes Magazine.\n\nAsk Sebastian Thrun what makes him tick, and the inventor and Google Fellow ­offers up three favorite themes: big open problems, a desire to help people and “disrespect for authority.” Thrun, 45, has been aiming high—and annoying the old guard—for nearly two decades. As a college student in Germany he dashed off to conferences to present major papers on machine learning without getting his professor’s permission. Thrun made the cover of FORBES in 2006 with his talk of creating self-driving cars that could navigate traffic and follow directions without human guidance. As the founding head of Google’s advanced-research X Lab, Thrun helped turn those robocars into reality. After 200,000 miles of road tests his vehicles are safe enough for Nevada to approve them on public roads. California may follow suit.\n\nThrun has found a fresh challenge that excites him even more: fixing higher education. Conventional ­university teaching is way too costly, inefficient and ­ineffective to survive for long, he contends. He wants to ­foment a teaching revolution in which the world’s best instructors conduct highly interactive online classes that let them reach 100,000 students simultaneously and globally.\n\nFinanciers at Charles River Ventures have already pumped $5 million into Thrun’s online-ed startup, Udacity. “I like to back people who have disruptive ­personalities,” explains CRV partner George Zachary. “They create disruptive solutions.”\n\nUdacity’s earliest course offerings have been free, and although Thrun eventually plans to charge something, he wants his tuition schedule to be shockingly low. Getting a master’s degree might cost just $100. After teaching his own artificial intelligence class at Stanford last year—and attracting 160,000 online signups—Thrun believes online formats can be far more effective than traditional classroom lectures. “So many people can be helped right now,” Thrun declares. “I see this as a mission.”\n\nThere’s a startup boom in online higher education, but nearly all of the players hope to advance by working within the system. EdX is a joint venture of Harvard and MIT. Coursera has backing from Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania. 2Tor, which has raised $90 million in venture capital, runs online graduate programs in business and nursing for the likes of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Georgetown. Such startups see benefits in teaming up with universities to ­decide what should be taught online, how to teach it and how to handle delicate issues such as grading, course credits, diplomas and anticheating safeguards.\n\nSuch careful collegiality is not the Thrun way. “It’s pretty obvious that degrees will go away,” Thrun says. “The idea of a degree is that you spend a fixed time right after high school to educate yourself for the rest of your career. But ­careers change so much over a lifetime now that this model isn’t valid anymore.”\n\nSo Udacity is charting its own path as a career academy for brainy people of all ages. Udacity’s offices are just a few hundred yards from Stanford, but they’re a world away from the school’s idyllic environs. Its open, barnlike work area has stained beige carpets, cheap desks and a Go board perched on a flimsy coffee table. Most of its 25 employees are video, graphics or software whizzes determined to make each second of online instruction as eye-catching and compelling as possible.\n\nIt currently offers 11 courses, for free, in subjects such as computer programming, statistics and mathematics, plus a robocar programmer’s workshop with Thrun himself. It rustles up some instructors from the likes of Rutgers and the state universities of Virginia and Utah. Other teachers are experts from industry. Faculty pay runs between $5,000 and $10,000 per course. Many of Udacity’s students are midcareer professionals who want to sharpen specific skills. Udacity later this year is expanding into the humanities. Thrun says the service will always have “a free path,” but the idea is eventually to charge for certificates or enhanced features such as chat.\n\nIt was only last year that Thrun seemed like a fast-track scholar thriving within academia. In eight years he rose from a Ph.D. student at the University of Bonn to a tenured post in Stanford’s computer science department (with a stint in between at Carnegie Mellon). “I was a popular professor,” Thrun says. “My teaching ratings were usually good. I could take complicated subjects and explain them in an entertaining way.”\n\nEven so, professor Thrun privately knew something was wrong. In many of his classes students fared much worse on the midterm exams than he expected. He says he had fallen into the “lecturing trap,” in which the instructor looks brilliant and a handful of top-performing students create the appearance of a lively class—but most students aren’t keeping pace. Thrun needed a way to engage all students.\n\nDown the road in Mountain View an obscure hedge fund analyst named Salman Khan was winning acclaim for his short math tutorials watched by millions on YouTube. At Stanford another computer science professor, Daphne Koller, was finding success by experimenting with ways to “flip” the classroom, covering lecture material as video homework while using scheduled class time to solve problems.\n\nThrun decided to apply new elements to a fall 2011 artificial intelligence class that he and Google research chief Peter Norvig cotaught at Stanford. They offered a free ­online version to the world, attracting 58,000 signups by August. After a burst of press coverage, enrollment tripled. Online dilettantes dropped out fast, but 23,000 committed learners finished the course. To Thrun’s delight many of them aced his exams. By Thrun’s tally he influenced more students through that single online course than he had in all his two decades of classroom teaching.\n\nThrun in January let the world know his full-time status at Stanford was over. The retreat evoked mixed feelings on campus. He had already surrendered tenure in March 2011 because his off-campus commitments (such as starting the Google Glass augmented reality program) claimed too many hours. Running Udacity is his main job now, though he has a 20% time commitment at Stanford as a research professor, guiding graduate students. He still works one day a week at Google, reporting to Sergey Brin.\n\nThrun lets his Udacity students know he is a Stanford professor, but he knows he can’t promote Udacity as a conduit to Stanford’s top professors. Doing his best to be diplomatic, Thrun in late May called his association with Stanford “fantastic.” Computer science department chair Jennifer Widom returned the courtesy, declaring herself “a big fan of Sebastian.” Still, tensions exist.\n\nWhen Thrun started sketching out his online course in the summer of 2011, he briefly considered ways of offering some of Stanford’s cachet to the free online students. ­Stanford administrators shuddered. “We told Sebastian: ‘You really can’t do that,’” Widom recalled. So online students didn’t get a completion certificate with a Stanford ­insignia; they also didn’t get a sheet showing how their test scores compared with those of Stanford students.\n\nBig-name universities are understandably loath to alter long-held procedures for course content, academic credit and faculty status. So be it, Thrun says. Udacity, still in its infancy, can write its own rulebook. Thrun’s philosophy of online teaching involves a nonstop barrage of online quizzes, one every two to five minutes, that become the centerpieces of each lesson. “You don’t lose weight by watching someone else exercise,” he says. “You don’t learn by watching someone else solve problems. It became clear to me that the only way to do online learning effectively is to have students solve problems.”\n\nSometimes a quiz will call for a quick calculation. Other times students must choose among options or create a line or two of computer code. Students’ entries can be automatically scored within seconds. A correct answer lets students move on right away; a faulty solution elicits an offer to try again.\n\nWhimsy is a frequent visitor. In an introductory course on search engine techniques, instructor David Evans, a Virginia professor, explains network design by sketching a map of ancient Greece, with stylized little bonfires showing how primitive smoke signals helped spread the word that Agamemnon had returned from battle. Evans then asks ­students to identify ways that this long-ago network could be made to operate faster. Among the options: Zeus could increase the speed of light.\n\nThanks to a global boom in cheap, high-speed Internet connectivity, such courses can be beamed around the world for just 50 cents to $1 per student. That makes mass teaching much more affordable than it was a few years ago. Just as important, the rise of Facebook, Twitter and other social networks means that today’s students are comfortable forming multihour study groups with online acquaintances they’ve never met in the physical world.\n\nUdacity’s engineers are learning which little things they need to get right. The company’s production studio carefully avoids full-body shots of professors lecturing; that makes for tiresome viewing. Instead, most footage consists of close-up shots of instructors writing out key lecture points on a digital tablet. Clever editing speeds up long words. When everything clicks, one instructor says, “it feels like a personal tutorial.”\n\nTechnique alone will carry Udacity only so far. Figuring out how to assess 100,000 people’s work in the humanities or social sciences will be a huge challenge. There, tough questions aren’t meant to elicit the same answer from everyone who knows the subject. Thrun has high hopes for peer-based grading, perhaps with a social-reputation score attached, so that classmates help identify their wisest peers. But such methods haven’t been tested yet.\n\nAnother roadblock: making sure that grade-obsessed students don’t cheat by swapping answers among friends or setting up lots of dummy accounts that they control. It’s an awkward secret of online education: People who crave an A can use multiple accounts to learn so much about course design that they can masquerade as geniuses when finally retaking the course under their own names.\n\nThrun’s decision to shake free of any direct ties to big-name universities could haunt him, too. Rival player Coursera is building up its course catalog faster, thanks to outspoken support from a variety of university presidents.\n\nStill, Thrun likes his odds. “I love to throw myself into situations where I don’t understand everything yet,” he says. “That way I learn so much. Sometimes I fail, and sometimes I succeed. But the goal is to reemerge at the other end, doing something good.”\n',4);
